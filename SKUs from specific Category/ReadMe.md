**This SQL query retrieves information from three tables:**

*catalog_product_entity, catalog_category_product, and catalog_category_entity.*

Let's break it down step by step:

Selection: The query begins by selecting specific columns (entity_id and sku) from the catalog_product_entity table and aliases this table as p.

Joint Operations: It performs two joins:

First join (JOIN catalog_category_product AS cp ON p.entity_id = cp.product_id): This links the catalog_product_entity table (p) with the catalog_category_product table (cp) using the entity_id from p and product_id from cp.

Second join (JOIN catalog_category_entity AS c ON cp.category_id = c.entity_id): This joins the catalog_category_product table (cp) with the catalog_category_entity table (c) using the category_id from cp and entity_id from c.

Filtering: The WHERE clause (WHERE c.entity_id = '806') filters the results by specifying that only records where the entity_id in the catalog_category_entity table (c) matches the value '806' will be retrieved.

In summary, this query retrieves entity_id and sku information from catalog_product_entity for products that are associated with the category having the entity_id '806' in the database.
